## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I used one which was from -> https://www.cssfontstack.com/Trebuchet-MS

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Honestly, studying Computer Science really prepared me on how to start projects early so, as to get them done
early before it due date. But with this project, one of the challenges i faced was the amount of documentation i had to read. But having been faced with a 
similiar situation like this before i was able to keep calm and take each step as it came. Staying calm and collective helped me through this project

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The question i have is, is there a better way to debugged programs other than using the developer tool console.log. i found it interesting.
And the last question is, how much comment in the code was needed.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

if i had more hours to work on this project, i would spend adding some additional features like after each clues i would try to change the colors 
for each container. 
I would also add a sound at the end if the user wins or a sound if the user loses.
I will also want to change the the start/stop to be reposition in the middle
